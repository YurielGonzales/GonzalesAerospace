		<p id="sputstuff">Sputnik 1 was a small, spherical spacecraft measuring about 58 centimeters (23 inches)<br> in diameter and weighing around 83.6 kilograms (184 pounds). It was equipped with four<br> whip-like antennas and transmitted radio signals, which could be detected on Earth.<br> The satellite's main objective was to orbit the Earth and gather information about the density of the<br> upper atmosphere and the propagation of radio signals in space.The propulsion system of Sputnik 1<br> consisted of a modified R-7 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), known as the "Semiorka."<br> The R-7 ICBM was one of the most powerful rockets developed during that time and played a crucial role<br> in launching the satellite into space. The launch vehicle provided the<br> initial thrust to propel Sputnik 1 into orbit around the Earth.With a top speed of around 29,000MPH.</p>

		<p id="starstuff">Starship is a next-generation spacecraft being developed by SpaceX, the aerospace company founded by Elon Musk.<br> Designed for a wide range of missions, including crewed space travel, satellite deployment, lunar and Mars missions,<br> and point-to-point travel on Earth, Starship represents a significant leap forward in space transportation<br> technology.Starship features a stainless steel construction, which provides strength and durability while withstanding<br> the extreme conditions of space travel. The spacecraft has a distinctive conical shape with a wide base and a sleek,<br> aerodynamic design. It stands approximately 50 meters (165 feet) tall and is capable<br> of carrying a substantial payload, including both cargo and passengers.With an estimated top speed of 25,000MPH.</p>
